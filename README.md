# Classifying-silhouettes-of-vehicles
Classified vehicles into different types based on silhouettes which may be viewed from many angles.

Unsupervised Learning

Classified vehicles into different types based on silhouettes which may be viewed from many angles.Used K Means and 
Hierarchical clustering to find out the optimal number of clusters in the data.Used PCA in order to reduce dimensionality and SVM for classification.


DATA DESCRIPTION: The data contains features extracted from the silhouette of vehicles in different angles. Four "Corgie" model vehicles
were used for the experiment: a double decker bus, Cheverolet van, Saab 9000 and an Opel Manta 400 cars. This particular combination of
vehicles was chosen with the expectation that the bus, van and either one of the cars would be readily distinguishable, but it would be more
difficult to distinguish between the cars.All the features are numeric i.e. geometric features extracted from the silhouette.
